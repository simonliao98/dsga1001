Since the movie ratings are meaningless if reduced to mean and we are testing two sample, I used the Mann Whiteney U test instead of t-test to test whether there is a difference in frequency of ratings between high popularity movies and low popularity moviews. For question 1 to 8, I used the Mann Whitney U test for the same reason, but according to different test circumstance I used different hypothesis. For question 1, the null hypothesis is that high popularity movies would are not higher than low popularity movies.
