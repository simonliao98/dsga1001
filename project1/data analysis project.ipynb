    "I first filtered out all the franchise movies, and there are more than two movies for each franchise, so we cannot use Mann-Whitney again. And we cannot use normal one-way anova, since the data is movie rating. I found that Kruskal-Wallis H-test is a non-parametric version of ANOVA, which is to test the median for 2 or more samples, which may have different sample sizes. I also find the Friedman test is a appriopriate in this circumstance but it does not support different sample size for each sample, so I finally choose Kruskal-Wallis H test. The null hypothesis of the test is that all movies in the franchise have consistent quality (the median of the ratings have no difference). Using the KW H-test on the 8 franchise movies, I found that only the Harry Potter Series generated a p-value higher than 0.05, that is saying, under 0.05 significance level, We fail to reject that Harry Potter Series has consistent quality, while for the other 7 franchise movies, we rejeceted that their quality is consistent. Inconclusion, 7 out of 8 franchise movies have inconsistent quanlity."
